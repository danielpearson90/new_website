## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist at UNSW Sydney. I am currently working as a post-doctoral research associate on projects examining the influence of learned experience (i.e., selection history) on perception, selective attention, and cognitive control.

I am interested in understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying visual cognition, with a view to applying these findings to real world contexts (e.g., designing alerts and warnings to rapidly capture attention) as well as to further our understanding of psychopathology (e.g., understanding how attention to reward-related cues interacts with substance use disorder and psychosis).

You can find the details of my recent publications and presentations below.

## Research Interest

- Visual cognition
- The influence of reward learning and prediction on perception (especially visual attention)
- The role of perceptual biases in mental illness
- Cognitive models of psychosis
